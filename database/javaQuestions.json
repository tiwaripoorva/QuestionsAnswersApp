  },
  "question": "What is a Class in Java?",
  "answer": "A class is a **blueprint** or **template** for creating objects. It defines the state (fields/variables) and behavior (methods) that its objects will have."

  "_id": {
    "$oid": "6900925bd2ef72332dbf35d0"
  },
  "question": "What is an Object in Java?",
  "answer": "An object is an **instance of a class**. It is a real-world entity that has a state and behavior, and occupies memory."

{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "6900925bd2ef72332dbf35d1"
  },
  "question": "What is Encapsulation?",
  "answer": "Encapsulation is the mechanism of **bundling the data (variables) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class)**. It also involves **data hiding** by making the variables private."

{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "6900925bd2ef72332dbf35d2"
  },
  "question": "What is Inheritance?",
  "answer": "Inheritance is the mechanism where one class (**subclass/child class**) acquires the properties and behaviors of another class (**superclass/parent class**). It promotes code reusability."

    "$oid": "6900925bd2ef72332dbf35d5"
  },
  "question": "What is the difference between Method Overloading and Method Overriding?",
  "answer": "Method Overloading is having multiple methods with the **same name but different parameters** (Compile-time Polymorphism). Method Overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass (Runtime Polymorphism)."

{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "6900925bd2ef72332dbf35ec"
  },
  "question": "Explain Widening Type Casting.",

  "question": "What happens to static members when an object is created?",
  "answer": "Nothing new happens; the static members are **already loaded** into memory when the class is loaded."

  "question": "What is polymorphism in the context of a reference variable?",
  "answer": "A **superclass reference variable** can hold a reference to an object of its **subclass**."

  },
  "question": "Can you call a non-static method from a static context (method)?",
  "answer": "No, because static methods exist without an object, and non-static methods require an object instance to be called."

  "question": "What is the role of the Garbage Collector (GC)?",
  "answer": "The GC is a part of the JVM responsible for **automatically managing memory** by reclaiming space occupied by objects that are no longer referenced by the application."

  "question": "What is a deeply copied object?",
  "answer": "An object where **all nested objects** (referenced fields) are also **recursively copied**, making the new object completely independent of the original."

    "$oid": "6900925bd2ef72332dbf3626"
  },
  "question": "What is a shallowly copied object?",
  "answer": "An object where only the **field values** are copied. If a field is a reference type, the **reference** is copied, meaning both objects point to the *same* nested object."

  "question": "What is a generic class/method?",
  "answer": "A feature that allows classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on **objects of various types** while maintaining **type safety** at compile time."

  "question": "What is exception handling related to OOP?",
  "answer": "It allows a program to **gracefully handle runtime errors** by catching and managing exceptions that break the normal flow, which aligns with building robust systems."
